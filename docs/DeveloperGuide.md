## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `VisitListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures common behavior for JavaFX UI components.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in corresponding `.fxml` files located in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to the `Model` so that the UI can update automatically with the modified data.
* displays both a list of persons (`PersonListPanel`) and a list of visits (`VisitListPanel`), bound to the filtered and sorted lists provided by the `Model`.
* depends on classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Visit` objects stored in the `Model`.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `MedLoggerParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `MedLoggerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `MedLoggerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the Med Logger data i.e., all `Person` and `Visit` objects (which are contained in `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueVisitList` respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` and `Visit` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Visit>` that can be observed e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data changes.
* stores a `SortedList<Visit>` that wraps around the filtered visit list to enable dynamic sorting based on user commands, such as sorting visits by date in ascending or descending order.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `MedLogger`, which `Person` references. This allows `MedLogger` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Med Logger data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `MedLoggerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### AddVisit feature
![AddVisitCommand Sequence Diagram.png](images/AddVisitCommand%20Sequence%20Diagram.png)
#### Implementation

The current implementation of AddVisitCommand works as following: it will pass the visit to the model, and the model will then call
the addVisit command of Medlogger, which check if that visit belongs to someone already exists in Medlogger. The check is done using the NRIC of the person of visit,
if NRIC exists as key of hashmap, then the person already exists in Medlogger and NRIC is used to retrieve the person, then
add the visit to Medlogger. Otherwise a CommandException is throw, and reject adding the visit. 

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedMedLogger`. It extends `MedLogger` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `medLoggerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedMedLogger#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current Med Logger state in its history.
* `VersionedMedLogger#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous Med Logger state from its history.
* `VersionedMedLogger#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone Med Logger state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitMedLogger()`, `Model#undoMedLogger()` and `Model#redoMedLogger()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedMedLogger` will be initialized with the initial Med Logger state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Med Logger state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the Med Logger. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitMedLogger()`, causing the modified state of the Med Logger after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `MedLoggerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Med Logger state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitMedLogger()`, causing another modified Med Logger state to be saved into the `MedLoggerStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitMedLogger()`, so the Med Logger state will not be saved into the `MedLoggerStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoMedLogger()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Med Logger state, and restores the Med Logger to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial MedLogger state, then there are no previous MedLogger states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoMedLogger()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoMedLogger()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the Med Logger to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `MedLoggerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Med Logger state, then there are no undone MedLogger states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoMedLogger()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the Med Logger, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitMedLogger()`, `Model#undoMedLogger()` or `Model#redoMedLogger()`. Thus, the `MedLoggerStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitMedLogger()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `MedLoggerStateList`, all Med Logger states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Med Logger.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### SortVisits feature
![SortVisitsCommand Sequence Diagram](images/DG_sortvisits.png)
<puml src="diagrams/SortVisitsDiagram.puml" width="500" />

#### Implementation

The `SortVisitsCommand` allows users to sort the current visit list based on the visit date and time. It supports both ascending and descending order.

This command uses a comparator to sort the list of visits by comparing the `DateTime` field. Internally, it calls the `model.sortFilteredVisitList(comparator)` method, which performs the sorting and updates the predicate of the `FilteredList` to reflect the new sorted order.

Due to the immutability of JavaFXâ€™s `FilteredList`, direct sorting is not allowed. Instead, the list is copied and sorted separately, and then the model updates the predicate so that the UI reflects the sorted order.

The command uses the following logic:
- If `isDescending` is `false`, the comparator sorts in natural ascending order.
- If `isDescending` is `true`, the comparator is reversed.

The visit panel (`VisitListPanel`) will reflect the sorted order immediately as it is bound to the filtered list.

### ListVisits Feature

The `listvisits` command displays a list of visit records currently stored in the MedLogger. Users can optionally limit the number of visits displayed using the `l/` prefix or filter by NRIC using `n/`.

#### Implementation

The implementation follows a standard command-parsing-execution pipeline:

![ListVisitsCommand Sequence Diagram](images/DG_listvisits.png)
<puml src="diagrams/ListVisitsDiagram.puml" width="500" />

1. User inputs the `listvisits` command.
2. The `MedLoggerParser` routes the command to the `ListVisitsCommandParser`, which optionally parses prefixes like `l/` (limit) and `n/` (NRIC).
3. A `ListVisitsCommand` is constructed with the parsed arguments and executed.
4. It updates the filtered visit list in `ModelManager` using a custom predicate.
5. The UI observes the updated list and reflects the changes immediately.

This design reuses the filtered list mechanism also used for persons, allowing seamless display updates via JavaFX binding.
